<p>Baseball was never my favorite sport to play, but I loved to watch it.<br> The best player to <I><b>ever</b></I> swing a bat in my opinion is David Ortiz.   </p>
<IMG SRC="david.jpg" align="right" Width="500" height="200">
<P> During his 14 seasons with the Red Sox, he was a ten-time All-Star, a three-time World Series champion, and seven-time Silver Slugger winner. Ortiz also holds the Red Sox single-season record for home runs with 54, which he set during the 2006 season.</p>

<p> The pitch that I would have to say is my all time favorite but might not be the best to ever play would be Pedro Mart√≠nez.
