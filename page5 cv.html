<h2> Patriots are my favorite football team. I have watched the Patriots from a young age. It has beed quite easy to be a pats fan. We are witnessing the greatest QB of all time and maybe the best coaching also.   </h2>

<h3> The Red Soxs would be my favorite baseball team. I used to watch the Sox's religiously growing up with my grandfather. I have witnessed several Red sox championships in my life-time and hope to see many more.</h3>

<h4> Real Madrid would be my favorite soccer team in general not just in the LaLiga. With Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale leading the team they are basically unstoppable.</h4>
