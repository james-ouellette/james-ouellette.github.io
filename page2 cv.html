<p> On this page I will go into detail about my favorite player at the quarterback, runningback and wide receiver positions.</p>
<IMG SRC="line.gif" width="600">
<p>My number one all time favorite NFL player is Tom Brady. I have watched Brady all my life and it was a true blessing watching the greatest quarterback of all time.</p>

<p> My favorite runningback would have to be Marshawn Lynch. After seeing his run vs the Saints its hard for him not to be my favorite. (I will link a video of the run at the bottom of the page.)  </p>

<p> My all time favorite wide receiver would have to be the one and only Randy Moss. His hands, foot work and swagger makes Moss a one-of-a-kind. </p>
